    "text": "1. Client-Centric Research & Insight Gathering\nAt Evam Tech Labs, I was involved with a crucial role in the development of the Performance Management Module for our HRM platform, called PulseHRM. I interviewed HR leaders, managers, and stakeholders from 25 client organizations to understand their current performance evaluation process and values. This research was supported by direct access to HR datasets, which enabled me to conduct a deep study of how KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and KRAs (Key Result Areas) were being applied in real-world cases.\n2. Identifying the Need for Customization\nA major conclusion from my analysis was that ‘each organization had its methodology and expectations when it comes to KPIs and KRAs.’ Considering this, I suggested there should be a fully customizable framework. This recommendation became a core feature of the product, enabling clients to define, modify, and manage performance indicators in coordination with their different business objectives and organization structures.\n3. Driving Product Adoption & Client Engagement\nApart from product development, I actively dealt with new and existing clients to drive the inclusion of the module. In many cases, I made clients aware of our pre-built KPI and KRA models, especially when they needed a ready-to-use structure. My ability to place product value and align it with business outcomes played a significant role in building client trust and onboarding.\n4. Bridging Product Strategy with Real-World Application\nBy blending customer-facing responsibilities with product strategy, I was able to ensure that PulseHRM’s performance module was not just technically relevant but also practical and user-friendly. These two responsibilities enabled me to convert complex client requirements into actionable software features, delivering a scalable, adaptable, and effective performance management solution.\nhttps://pulsehrm.com/about-pulsehrm/"
